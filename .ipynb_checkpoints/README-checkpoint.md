# Think Python Excercises Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the excercises provided in Think Python eBook by Allen B Downey. (https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html)

Purpose for documenting these solution is to measure how differently do I approach the same problem with time and experience and also share with fellow learners to review, understand and share their point of view.

Enjoy learning and working with Python!
